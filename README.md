# Ceph ePub Builder

This patches the ceph repository and lets you build the entire Ceph documentation as an .epub for easy consumption and reference.

### Usage:
* `./build.sh [git tag/commit]`
* You might get asked to install dependencies by the documentation builder if you don't have them.
* Result is copied to root directory
